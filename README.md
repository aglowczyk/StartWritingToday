# StartWritingToday is a small app for kids. Long story short is shows a picture if a word is written correctly. 

More info below. Have fun!

1. Think about easy words which Your kid can handle, let's say cat
◦ easy 3-letter words are perfect for the beginning
◦ You can use paper dictionary for children to help with writing, it this case little
learner is aware what he/she can type without remembering it, the real goal here is
to ability to analyze the word and combine the letters, not to remembers a list of
available words
2. Get an image with a cat, name it cat.jpg and put it into images folder
◦ gif, png, jpg, jpeg extensions are allowed, any other extensions will be ignored
◦ if there are two files with the cat (let's say cat.gif, and cat.jpg), the cat.gif will be
taken into consideration. Priorities are GIF > PNG > JPG > JPEG
3. Launch the application (double click on *.exe file)
◦ Be carefull with deleting and adding images while app is running - i can't guarantee
that it will work properly, it is safer to relaunch application it this case.
4. Type cat and press enter (or click the v button)
5. If you enter the word and put file correctly – the image should be shown.
6. Let Your kid has fun!
◦ expand the possibilities of Your program with time! You can show the difference it
similar words and plural forms, You can also show Your kid that two different words
can mean exactly the same (for example in different language).
◦ let Your kid choose what he/she want to write – it should be fun for them :)
