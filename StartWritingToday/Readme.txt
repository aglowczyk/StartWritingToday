Main goal of this application is to help kids with bulding words and get used to qwerty and language - You can do it in Your way.
Application is based on the folder "images" where You should put Your files with propert names and extensions.
Then launch application, write something, press enter > Application search for the exact name within files and - if found - show it.
Be carefull with deleting and adding images while app is running - i can't guarantee that it will work properly, it is safer to relaunch application it this case.
If there are several files with the same name and different extenstions, application should get it in order: GIF, PNG, JPG, JPEG (other extensions are unsupported).

that's it.

We are working with dictionary for children as a base for words, the youngest are just writting simple 3-letter words.

Enjoy!
